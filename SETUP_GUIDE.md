## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Capacitor Config (`capacitor.config.json`)
```json
{
  "appId": "com.floodprediction.app",      // Change this to your bundle ID
  "appName": "Flood Prediction System",    // Your app name
  "webDir": "www",
  "plugins": {
    "SplashScreen": {
      "launchShowDuration": 3000,
      "backgroundColor": "#1e3a8a"
    },
    "StatusBar": {
      "style": "dark",
      "backgroundColor": "#031D40"
    }
  }
}
```

### API Configuration (`www/js/app.js`)
Update these settings based on your needs:
- `baseURL`: Your Flask API endpoint
- Location settings and permissions
- Notification preferences
- Map configuration

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"CocoaPods not installed"**
```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
cd ios/App && pod install
```

**"Cannot connect to API"**
- Check if Flask backend is running
- Verify API URL in `www/js/app.js`
- Check network permissions

**"Location not working"**
- Add location permission in Info.plist
- Test on physical device (location doesn't work in some simulators)

**Build errors in Xcode**
- Clean build folder (Product → Clean Build Folder)
- Re-run `npx cap sync`
- Check iOS deployment target compatibility

### Performance Tips
- Optimize images and assets
- Use CDN for external libraries
- Implement proper loading states
- Cache API responses when possible

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Deploy Flask Backend**: Use Heroku, Railway, or Render
2. **Test iOS App**: Run on simulator and physical device
3. **Customize UI**: Modify colors, layout, and branding
4. **Add Features**: Implement push notifications, offline mode
5. **App Store**: Prepare for submission
