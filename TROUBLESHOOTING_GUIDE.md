   - Change to match registered bundle ID

### Issue: "Archive Failed - Code Sign Error"
**Symptoms**: Archive process fails with signing errors
**Solutions**:
1. **Enable Automatic Signing**:
   - Project settings ‚Üí Signing & Capabilities
   - Check "Automatically manage signing"
   - Select your team from dropdown

2. **Clean Certificates**:
   - Xcode ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Accounts
   - Select your account ‚Üí Manage Certificates
   - Delete old certificates, download fresh ones

3. **Reset Provisioning Profiles**:
   - Xcode ‚Üí Window ‚Üí Devices and Simulators

   - Delete old profiles

### Issue: "Build Failed - Missing Dependencies"
**Symptoms**: Build errors about missing frameworks or libraries
**Solutions**:
1. **Clean and Rebuild**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/digantohaque/python/flood-ios-app
   npx cap sync ios
   ```

2. **Update CocoaPods**:
   ```bash
   cd ios/App
   pod install --repo-update
   ```

3. **Check Capacitor Plugins**:
   ```bash
   npm ls @capacitor/core
   npm update @capacitor/core
   ```

## üåê API CONNECTIVITY ISSUES

### Issue: "Network Request Failed"
**Symptoms**: App can't connect to backend API
**Solutions**:
1. **Verify Backend Status**:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://flood-prediction-app-lkmp.onrender.com/api/status
   ```
   Should return: `"status":"operational"`

2. **Check iOS Network Security**:
   - Verify `Info.plist` allows your domain:
   ```xml
   <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
   <dict>
       <key>flood-prediction-app-lkmp.onrender.com</key>
       <dict>
           <key>NSRequiresCertificateTransparency</key>
           <false/>
       </dict>
   </dict>
   ```

3. **Test Network Permissions**:
   - Ensure app requests network permissions
   - Check iOS Simulator network connectivity

### Issue: "CORS Error in Web Version"
**Symptoms**: API calls work in iOS but fail in web browser
**Solutions**:
1. **Backend CORS Configuration** (if you control the backend):
   ```python
   from flask_cors import CORS
   CORS(app, origins=["capacitor://localhost", "http://localhost"])
   ```

2. **iOS vs Web Differences**:
   - iOS uses native networking (no CORS restrictions)
   - Web version needs CORS headers from server
   - This shouldn't affect App Store submission

## üì± iOS SIMULATOR ISSUES

### Issue: "Location Services Not Working"
**Symptoms**: GPS/location features don't work in simulator
**Solutions**:
1. **Enable Simulator Location**:
   - Simulator ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Location ‚Üí Custom Location
   - Enter: Latitude 23.8103, Longitude 90.4125 (Dhaka)

2. **Test on Physical Device**:
   - Connect iPhone via USB
   - Select device instead of simulator in Xcode
   - Build and run on physical device

3. **Check Location Permissions**:
   - iOS Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Location Services
   - Find your app and enable permissions

### Issue: "Simulator Crashes or Freezes"
**Symptoms**: Simulator becomes unresponsive during app testing
**Solutions**:
1. **Reset Simulator**:
   - Simulator ‚Üí Device ‚Üí Erase All Content and Settings
   - Restart simulator and try again

2. **Free Up System Resources**:
   - Close other applications
   - Restart Xcode and Simulator
   - Check available disk space (need 5GB+)

3. **Use Different Simulator**:
   - Window ‚Üí Devices and Simulators
   - Add iPhone 15 Pro Max simulator
   - Delete old simulators to free memory

## üè™ APP STORE CONNECT ISSUES

### Issue: "Screenshots Wrong Size"
**Symptoms**: Error when uploading screenshots to App Store Connect
**Solutions**:
1. **Verify Exact Dimensions**:
   - iPhone 6.7": Must be exactly 1290 √ó 2796 pixels
   - iPhone 6.5": Must be exactly 1242 √ó 2688 pixels
   - Use Preview ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Adjust Size to resize

2. **Check File Format**:
   - Must be PNG or JPEG
   - RGB color space
   - Under 500KB per file

3. **Recreate Screenshots**:
   - Use iOS Simulator ‚Üí Device ‚Üí iPhone 15 Pro Max
   - Take fresh screenshots with ‚åò+S
   - Don't resize existing screenshots if possible

### Issue: "App Description Rejected"
**Symptoms**: Apple rejects app for misleading description
**Solutions**:
1. **Match Description to Functionality**:
   - Only describe features that actually work
   - Don't mention features not yet implemented
   - Be accurate about prediction accuracy claims

2. **Remove Promotional Language**:
   - Avoid terms like "best," "revolutionary," "perfect"
   - Focus on factual feature descriptions
   - Don't compare to competitors

3. **Add Appropriate Disclaimers**:
   ```
   This app provides flood risk assessments and should be used in conjunction with official weather services and emergency information.
   ```

### Issue: "Privacy Policy Issues"
**Symptoms**: Rejection due to privacy policy problems
**Solutions**:
1. **Ensure Privacy Policy is Accessible**:
   - Test URL works in browser
   - Loads quickly (under 3 seconds)
   - Contains actual privacy information (not placeholder)

2. **Match App Behavior**:
   - Privacy policy must accurately describe what data you collect
   - Location data: Yes (for flood predictions)
   - Personal data: No
   - Third-party sharing: No

3. **Host on Reliable Platform**:
   - GitHub Pages (free, reliable)
   - Personal website

   - Use Apple Developer support channels
   - Provide app name and upload timestamp

### Issue: "Invalid Binary" Error
**Symptoms**: Upload rejected immediately with validation errors
**Solutions**:
1. **Common Binary Issues**:
   - Wrong iOS deployment target (should be 12.0+)
   - Missing required device capabilities
   - Invalid bundle identifier

2. **Rebuild from Clean State**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/digantohaque/python/flood-ios-app
   npx cap sync ios
   # In Xcode: Product ‚Üí Clean Build Folder
   # Then: Product ‚Üí Archive
   ```

3. **Check Xcode Organizer Logs**:
   - View detailed error messages in Organizer
   - Address each validation error specifically

## üìã REVIEW PROCESS ISSUES
