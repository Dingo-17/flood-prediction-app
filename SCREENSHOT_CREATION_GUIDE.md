2. This gives you the 6.7" display size needed

### Step 3: Navigate Through Your App
Take screenshots of these 5 key screens:

#### Screenshot 1: Main Dashboard
- **What to show**: Main flood prediction map with location markers
- **How**: 
  1. Let the app fully load
  2. Ensure map shows flood monitoring locations
  3. Make sure UI elements are clearly visible
  4. Press **‚åò+S** to save screenshot

#### Screenshot 2: Location Selection
- **What to show**: Location picker or search interface
- **How**:
  1. Tap location selector or search
  2. Show dropdown/list of available locations
  3. Press **‚åò+S** to save

#### Screenshot 3: Flood Prediction Results  
- **What to show**: Detailed prediction for a specific location
- **How**:
  1. Select a location (try Dhaka)
  2. Wait for prediction to load
  3. Show risk level, probability, recommendations
  4. Press **‚åò+S** to save

#### Screenshot 4: Risk Assessment Details
- **What to show**: Detailed analysis screen
- **How**:
  1. Navigate to detailed risk breakdown
  2. Show charts, graphs, or risk factors
  3. Include safety recommendations if visible

### Step 4: Create 6.5" Screenshots
1. In Simulator, go to **Device ‚Üí iPhone 15 Plus**
2. Repeat the same 5 screenshots
3. Content should be identical, just resized for different screen

### Step 5: Find Your Screenshots
- Screenshots save to **Desktop** by default
- Look for files named like `Simulator Screen Shot - iPhone 15 Pro Max - 2025-07-28 at XX.XX.XX.png`

## üé® METHOD 2: DESIGN TOOL SCREENSHOTS (ALTERNATIVE)

If iOS Simulator screenshots don't look professional enough:

### Using Figma (Free)
1. **Create new file** at figma.com
2. **Set frame size**: 1290 √ó 2796 pixels
3. **Add device mockup**:
   - Search Figma Community for "iPhone 15 Pro Max mockup"
   - Use a clean, modern mockup
4. **Insert your app screens**:
   - Take basic screenshots from simulator
   - Place them inside the device mockup
   - Adjust brightness/contrast for better visibility

### Using Screenshot Tools
- **CleanShot X**: Professional screenshot editor
- **Rottenwood**: App Store screenshot generator
